iChanged in version 2.3: The protocol parameter was added.

pickle.loads(string)
Read a pickled object hierarchy from a string. Characters in the string past the pickled objectâ€™s representation are ignored.

The pickle module also defines three exceptions:

exception pickle.PickleError
A common base class for the other exceptions defined below. This inherits from Exception.

exception pickle.PicklingError
This exception is raised when an unpicklable object is passed to the dump() method.

exception pickle.UnpicklingError
This exception is raised when there is a problem unpickling an object. Note that other exceptions may also be raised during unpickling, including (but not necessarily limited to) AttributeError, EOFError, ImportError, and IndexError.

The pickle module also exports two callables [2], Pickler and Unpickler:

class pickle.Pickler(file[, protocol])
This takes a file-like object to which it will write a pickle data stream.

If the protocol parameter is omitted, protocol 0 is used. If protocol is specified as a negative value or HIGHEST_PROTOCOL, the highest protocol version will be used.

Changed in version 2.3: Introduced the protocol parameter.

file must have a write() method that accepts a single string argument. It can thus be an open file object, a StringIO object, or any other custom object that meets this interface.

Pickler objects define one (or two) public methods:

dump(obj)
